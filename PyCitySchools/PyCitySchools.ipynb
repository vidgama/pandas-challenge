    "# PyCity School Analysis\n",
    "    \n",
    "   ### Data Analyst:\n",
    "Vidal Garcia Martinez\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ### Summary: \n",
    "PyCity has 15 high schools with 39,170 students and a budget of $24,649,428. At least 70% of students passed either their standardized math or reading exams, however, only 65% passed both exams. The schools with highest budgets have the lowest  passing scores overall and, on the other hand, the schools with lowest budgest have the highest scores overall. \n",
    "\n",
    "The top-5 performing institutions are charter schools whereas public district schools see themselves in the bottom 5. Not only that, charter schools out-performed district schools by far, with a 90% overall passing against just 53%, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Students from all schools performed better in reading than math tests. Despite that, schools with higher budgets per student had inversely proportionate passing scores overall. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of student population, the school size didn't make much difference between small and medium schools but large schools had the poorest scores overall.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ### Conclusions: \n",
    "   \n",
    "* Big budgets per school and per capita do not guarantee better student performance\n",
    "* Charter schools have a clear advantage over district schools, so it would be interesting to know the contributing factors to their success (teaching practices, population size, etc). Remember we are talking about standardized tests. \n",
